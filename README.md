# MinecraftDataPack-OurVillagerDiscounts

This data pack is an alternative to the
[mod](https://github.com/Gremlite/MinecraftMod-OurVillagerDiscounts) that I
maintain.

You can either grab the file directly from releases, or from one of the following:

1. [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/datapack/our-villager-discounts-data-pack)
2. [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/our-villager-discounts-data-pack)

It shares zombie curing gossips across the server. You do need to right click a
villager twice to get the effect due to the limitations of data packs. If you
see a particle effect, it means you need to click off the villager because the
gossip value has changed. If there's no particles, it means it's already applied
(or there is no gossip to apply).

This data pack shares _only_ the major positive gossip (the zombie curing
gossip). This means trades may still differ if you, for example, punch a
villager. There is a [cooldown](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Villager#Gossiping),
however, so trades should return to the same over time.
